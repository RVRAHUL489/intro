        <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE AND EDUVATION(CSE)</h1>
        <p>Computer science and engineering (CSE) is an academic program at many universities 
            which comprises approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is 
            no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field
             of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically more related 
             to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering 
             (e.g. computer architecture). CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate 
             the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in 
             both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.</p>
